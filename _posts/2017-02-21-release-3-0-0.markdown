## What's new

**Everything we will talk about here is also available in the [changelog][changelog] and in the [upgrade guide][upgrade].**
**It's the first release to be fully compatible with all latest PHP versions (`7.x`).**

### Deprecations and breaking changes

As you may know atoum is released under the [semver][semver] convention. **The 3.0.0 release comes with its breaking 
changes**. Most of them are minor and you might not notice them but it's worth giving you some details.

#### Runtime

We have **dropped support for some PHP and xDebug versions**. atoum now supports PHP `>= 5.6.0` and xDebug `>= 2.3.0`.

Take care of the xDebug version you use: atoum might work with a version lower than `2.3.0` but you might encounter 
segfaults on latest PHP versions. **To avoid any problem it is recommended to use the latest stable version: `2.5.0`.**

#### Reports

atoum used to provide some fancy reports. You probably known them: the Nyancat and Santa reports. As these reports are 
not really usefull **they have been moved to the [`reports-extension`][reports-extension]**. If you
were using them, install the extension and they should work without requiring you to change anything to your 
configuration file.

Another thing about reports: atoum provides an advanced API to design your own reports. Reports in atoum use something 
we call "fields" to display information. One of those field had its class named `void`. In latest PHP versions, `void` 
is a reserved keyword thus we can't use it anymore in class names.

**The `void` class has been renamed to `blank`**. If you wrote custom reports using this field, you will have to use 
the new class name.

#### Assertions

We changed some assertions and helpers: `exception` and `when`.

atoum `2.x` supported PHP `>= 5.3.3`. Because on lower version `$this` in closures was not bound to the current object 
context, some assertions provided the test as an argument to closures.

**This is not the case anymore: you will have to change your tests** if you used this feature.

```php
// atoum 2.x

$this
    ->when(function(atoum\test $test) { 
        $test->testedInstance->doSomething();
    })
;

$this
    ->exception(function(atoum\test $test) { 
        $test->testedInstance->doSomethingAndThrow();
    })
;

// atoum 3.x

$this
    ->when(function() { 
        $this->testedInstance->doSomething();
    })
; 

$this
    ->exception(function() { 
        $this->testedInstance->doSomethingAndThrow();
    })
;
```

### New features and bug fixes

#### Asserting on generators

Because generators are awesome, you should be able to use them and test them correctly. [Adrien Gallou][@agallou] did a 
great job on writing this new asserter. It will allow you to walk through any generator and assert on the yielded 
values. Here is an example:

```php
$this
    ->generator($generator())
        ->yields->array
              ->isEqualTo(["1", "2", "3"])
              ->contains("1")
              ->string[0]->isEqualTo(1)
        ->yields->integer
              ->isZero
        ->yields->variable->isNull
        ->returns->variable->isEqualTo(42)
        //...
;
```

#### Coding style

Let's talk about the numbers. Especially one of them: you might have noticed the 580 files changed. This is a lot! 
atoum has a total of 557 files (source files and test files) so 580 is really a lot of change but this is for some good 
reasons. Guess what: **atoum finally adopted a common coding-style, [PSR-2][PSR-2]**.

We hope this will be a good move for two main reasons: lower the friction for new contributors and ease our work when 
reviewing PRs: We hooked up [StyleCI][StyleCI] and [PHP CS Fixer][PHP CS Fixer].

#### More

You might also check the changelog for the previous release [`2.9.0`][changelog_290] as it also introduced new features 
around the mock engine, array assertions and extensions.

### Asides

We released the VIM plugin as a standalone component: it now has its [own repository][vim-plugin].

We also released a Hombrew Tap with some formulae: [homebrew-atoum][homebrew-atoum].

A new website is available: [http://extensions.atoum.org/](http://extensions.atoum.org/) where you will be able to 
browse the list of extensions. We also added [topics][topics] (tags) on the repositories so you can find them on Github.

### Extensions

Some extensions have been updated:

* The [config-extension][config-extension] has been released,
* The [autoloop-extension][autoloop-extension] has been updated,
* The [visibility-extension][visibility-extension] has been updated,
* The [reports-extension][reports-extension] has been updated,
* The [json-schema-extension][json-schema-extension] has been updated.

We still need to update some extensions but the most used ones should already be OK.

### Documentation

We also updated missing parts of the documentation. Again, [our contributors][contributors] and our 
[doc master][@doc] did an amazing job! We will keep working on this part to improve it.
