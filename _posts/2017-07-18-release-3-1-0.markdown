## What's new

Several new feature and a bug fix came with this release.

Things related to PHP next version 7.1 & 7.2 to let atoum be ready for the next version of PHP:
* The mock generator can now manage nullable type and handle the void type
* The mock generator support strict types
* The object asserter has been renamed to phpObject to avoid issue related to reserved words in PHP 7.2 but with an alias to keep the compatibility and avoid any change in the 
day-to-day usage

### Assertions & asserters

#### Exception
Now the asserter on exception has an `isInstanceOf` that can be used assertions without brackets.

#### Stream
Now the asserter on stream has a `isRead` and `isWritten`  that can be used assertions without brackets.


```php
$this
    ->given($streamController = \atoum\mock\stream::get())
    ->if(file_get_contents($streamController->getPath()))
    ->then()
        ->stream($streamController)
            ->isRead();

// is now the same as
$this
    ->given($streamController = \atoum\mock\stream::get())
    ->if(file_get_contents($streamController->getPath()))
    ->then()
        ->stream($streamController)
            ->isRead;
```

Example is comming from the [documentation](http://docs.atoum.org/fr/latest/assertions.html#stream).

### Documentation

Since the last revision, a lot of improvements on [mock usage][documentation_mock] and on [configuration][documentation_configuration] have been made.
Several asserter and assertion have been added like for the resources, stream, generator or the constant.

You can see more on the [Change list][documentation].
