## What's new

### Use telemetry by atoum itself

As we [recently announced](/news/2016/05/17/here-comes-the-telemetry.html), we now provide a collaborative platform to share test results and statistics called [Telemetry].

According to the atoum's philosophy, atoum itself test executions now send results to the telemetry platform.

## Bugfixes

### Reports override correctly when using `-ulr`/`-utr`

Using `--use-light-report` or `--use-tap-report` no longer remove all defined reports (like Telemetry) but only those who are in conflict with light or TAP reports.

### Exception asserter handles new PHP7 features

`exception` assert handle correctly PHP7 [`Exception`](http://php.net/manual/fr/class.exception.php), [`Throwable`](http://php.net/manual/fr/class.throwable.php) and [`TypeErrors`](http://php.net/manual/en/class.typeerror.php) exceptions
