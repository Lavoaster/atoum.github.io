## What's new

### Use telemetry by atoum itself

As we recently announced, we now provide a collaborative platform to share tests results and statistics called [Telemetry].

According to the atoum's philosophy, atoum itself tests execution now send results to the telemetry platform.

## Bugfixes

### Reports override correctly when using -ulr/-utr

Using `--use-light-report` or `--use-tap-report` no longer remove all defined reports (like Telemetry) but only those who are in conflict with light or TAP reports.

### Assertions on PHP 7 exceptions/throwables/errors are now working correctly

`->exception()` assert handle correctly PHP7 `\Exception`, `\Throwable` and `\TypeErrors` exceptions
