    <h2>Release process</h2>

    <p>Historically, atoum is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling-release</a>
        software, it means without any versions. While this is very challenging
        because no regression must be introduced, this is not always comfortable for
        atoum's users that need versions, especially with a quality tool. That's why
        atoum uses <a href="http://www.semver.org/">the semantic versioning
            specification</a> too.</p>
    <p>You can set <a href="https://github.com/atoum/atoum/releases/latest">latest atoum's
        version</a>. A
        <a href="https://github.com/atoum/atoum/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"><code>CHANGELOG.md</code>
            file</a> is maintained up-to-date.</p>

    <p>atoum has 2&nbsp;release managers. They apply the following rules:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If a bug has been fixed, a new version is released as soon as
            possible (it addresses the <code>z</code> in <code>x.y.z</code>),</li>
        <li>Every 6&nbsp;weeks, a new version is released containing the new
            features (it addresses the <code>y</code> in <code>x.y.z</code>),</li>
        <li>If a backward-compatibility break is required, 2&nbsp;new versions are
            released: A first one only with the new features and a second one only with
            the backward-compatibility break (it addresses the <code>x</code> in
            <code>x.y.z</code>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Current release managers have been elected by the community and they are:
        <a href="https://github.com/Hywan">Ivan Enderlin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mikaelrandy">MikaÃ«l Randy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Install with Composer</h2>

    <p>The <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> tool is a dependency
        manager. All atoum's projects are registered on
        <a href="https://packagist.org/search/?q=atoum/">Packagist</a> repository
        under the names <code>atoum/<em>project</em></code>. Thus, the test
        framework is registered under <code>atoum/atoum</code> and extensions are
        registered under <code>atoum/<em>extension-name</em>-extension</code>.
        Consequently, assuming Composer is already installed, we need to write the
        following document in a <code>composer.</code> file:</p>

{% highlight json %}
{
    "require-dev": {
          "atoum/atoum": "~2.0"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>This notation means: All versions greater than
        <code>2.0</code> and lower
        than <code>3.0</code>, i.e. the latest safe major
        version until the next incompatible change in the API.</p>

    <p>One might notice that <code>atoum/atoum</code> has been declared as a
        <code>require-dev</code>, saying a development requirement. In fact, we are
        more likely to use atoum as a development tool rather than a production tool.
        Running tests in production does not sound a good idea. This may be done
        before releasing a software.</p>

    <p>Thus, to finally install atoum, simply run:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
$ composer install
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Composer also comes with a handy command-line tool that will save (by
        writing in the appropriate <code>composer.json</code> file) and install your
        dependency directly:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
$ composer require --dev atoum/atoum
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Composer will try to use a version syntax allowing to safely update to the
        latest version.</p>
    <p>Finally, to update atoum, simply run:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
$ composer update atoum/atoum
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Now, the <code>atoum</code> binary will be located in
        <code>vendor/bin/atoum</code>. Testing atoum is working well can be achieved
        by running its own test suites:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
$ vendor/bin/atoum --version
$ vendor/bin/atoum --test-it
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>The first line will print the version of atoum.</p>

    <h2>Install with a PHAR</h2>

    <p>PHP provides a <a href="http://php.net/phar">PHAR</a> file format, which is
        an executable archive likely to contain PHP code. atoum can be used inside a
        PHAR file.</p>

    <p>It is possible to <a href="https://github.com/atoum/atoum/releases/download/2.3.0/atoum.phar">download
        the latest PHAR ball</a> manually or to install it with
        <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> by running:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
$ curl -L https://github.com/atoum/atoum/releases/download/2.3.0/atoum.phar > /usr/local/bin/atoum.phar
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Finally, to update atoum, simply run:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
$ php -dphar.readonly=0 atoum.phar --update
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Note the <code>-dphar.readonly=0</code> option to make the PHAR writable
        for this execution.</p>

    <h2>Repositories</h2>

    <p>atoum is using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.
        <a href="https://github.com/atoum/atoum">Repositories are hosted on Github</a>
        under the eponym organization: atoum.</p>

    <p>Github is used to manage and track bugs, issues, roadmap etc. If you would
        like to report a bug, this will happen there.</p>
