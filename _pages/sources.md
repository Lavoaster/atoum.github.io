<section class="visual-section">
## Install with Composer

The [Composer][composer] tool is a dependency manager. All atoum's projects are registered on [Packagist][packagist] 
repository under the names <code>atoum/<em>project</em></code>. Thus, the test framework is registered under 
`atoum/atoum` and extensions are registered under <code>atoum/<em>extension-name</em>-extension</code>.
Consequently, assuming Composer is already installed, we need to run the following ccommand to add atoum to your project:

{% highlight sh %}
composer require --dev 'atoum/atoum'
{% endhighlight %}

One might notice that `atoum/atoum` has been declared as a `require-dev`, saying a development requirement. In fact,
we are more likely to use atoum as a development tool rather than a production tool. Running tests in production does
not sound a good idea. This may be done before releasing a software.

Thus, to finally install atoum, simply run:

{% highlight sh %}
$ composer install
{% endhighlight %}

Composer also comes with a handy command-line tool that will save (by writing in the appropriate `composer.json` file)
and install your dependency directly:

{% highlight sh %}
$ composer require --dev atoum/atoum
{% endhighlight %}

Composer will try to use a version syntax allowing to safely update to the latest version.

Finally, to update atoum, simply run:

{% highlight sh %}
$ composer update atoum/atoum
{% endhighlight %}

Now, the `atoum` binary will be located in `vendor/bin/atoum`. Testing atoum is working well can be achieved by running
its own test suites:

{% highlight sh %}
$ vendor/bin/atoum --version
$ vendor/bin/atoum --test-it
{% endhighlight %}

The first line will print the version of atoum.

## Install with a PHAR

PHP provides a [PHAR][php-phar] file format, which is an executable archive likely to contain PHP
code. atoum can be used inside a PHAR file.

It is possible to [download the latest PHAR ball][release-phar] manually or to install it with [cURL][curl] by running:

{% highlight sh %}
$ curl -L https://github.com/atoum/atoum/releases/download/2.5.0/atoum.phar > /usr/local/bin/atoum.phar
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, to update atoum, simply run:

{% highlight sh %}
$ php -dphar.readonly=0 atoum.phar --update
{% endhighlight %}

Note the `-dphar.readonly=0` option to make the PHAR writable for this execution.

## Release process

Historically, atoum is a [rolling-release] software, it means without any versions. While this is very challenging 
because no regression must be introduced, this is not always comfortable for atoum's users that need versions, 
especially with a quality tool. That's why atoum uses [the semantic versioning specification][semver] too.

You can see the [latest atoum's version][release]. A [`CHANGELOG.md` file][changelog] is kept up-to-date.

atoum has 2 release managers. They apply the following rules:

1. If a bug has been fixed, a new version is released as soon as possible (it addresses the `z` in `x.y.z`),
2. Every 6 weeks, a new version is released containing the new features (it addresses the `y` in `x.y.z`),
3. If a backward-compatibility break is required, 2 new versions are released: a first one only with the new features
   and a second one only with the backward-compatibility break (it addresses the `x` in `x.y.z`).

Current release managers have been elected by the community and they are:

* [Ivan Enderlin][@Hywan],
* [MikaÃ«l Randy][@mikaelrandy].

## Repositories

atoum is using [Git][git]. [Repositories are hosted on Github][atoum-repo-gh] under the eponym organization: 
[atoum][atoum-org-gh].

Github is used to manage and track bugs, issues, roadmap etc. If you would like to report a bug, this will happen there.
